            <p><a href="#">Marome Watches</a> will only make purchase offers to eligible customers over the age of 18 years old. You must be able to provide a valid state or government-issued photo id and will affirm that the item is theirs to sell.</p>
            <p>The estimated offer value is determined on a number of factors, mainly the watch's condition and its market demand.</p>
            <p>Marome Watches reserves the right to cancel a purchase offer at any time and the watch will be shipped back to the owner at the companies expense.</p>
            <p>Reasons for refusal may include (but are not limited to):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>bad condition</li>
                <li>misrepresentation</li>
                <li>miscommunications with the seller</li>
                <li>the watch is not in working condition  </li>
                <li>any part of the watch was not authentic. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once a final offer price is made and accepted by the customer they will be required to send a copy of their identification and a signed letter stating their intention to sell. When this information is received, a check or a bank transfer will be drawn in the seller's name.</p>
            <p>If you would like to trade your watch & put it towards the purchase of any item that we have, we will apply the credit towards the purchase.</p>


            <h3 class="my-4">OFFER QUOTE/FINAL OFFER DISCLAIMER; TERMS OF SALE</h3>
            <p>Marome Watches will provide an "Offer Quote" based on the information you provided. The offer will be quoted as a range. The range will be the lowest to the highest value we can determine, based on the information and pictures provided. </p>
            <p>You can expect your "Final Offer" value to be within this range, it may be possible that we offer you a price higher than this range but we will never make you an offer lower than the minimum price quoted. </p>
            <p>Be aware that making an Offer Quote does not guarantee we will purchase your watch. If your watch was misrepresented in any way, we will rescind the offer and ship the watch back immediately. </p>
            <p>Once a selling price has been agreed upon and all requested documentation has been received, we will issue a check for that amount and mail it to you, or wire a bank transfer for that amount, and inform you via email. </p>
            <p>Be aware that it may take 3 to 4 business days to issue a check, if in that time you decide to cancel the sale inform us immediately. If a check has already been mailed, simply mark the envelope “return to sender” and we will ship back the watch when the check is returned. </p>
            <p>Marome Watches will consider a sale complete when our bank indicates that the check has been cashed. Trade-ins are not eligible for returns or refunds, under the conditions stated in our return policy. We offer to exchange these items within 14 days of issuing the receipt.</p>

            <h3 class="my-4">OFFER EXPIRATION</h3>
            <p>All Final Offer quotes are valid for 30 days from the date the offer was made. If we do not receive a response from the seller within that 30 day period, the watch will be shipped back and the seller will be notified by email.</p>

            <h3 class="my-4">WATCH INSPECTION DISCLAIMER</h3>
            <p>By shipping your watch to Marome Watches you consent to have the watch thoroughly inspected, including opening the watch case. All work will be performed by one of our qualified watchmakers</p>
