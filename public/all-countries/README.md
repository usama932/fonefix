Countries and Provinces / States / Regions
==========================================

Data files listing Countries and their related Provinces/States/Regions.

Not all countries have a province file yet, those that do have a `filename` attribute in `countries.json`.

I created this project to help with populating HTML form fields, but it had a wide range of possible uses. Pull requests are welcome!
